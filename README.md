# Causal-Inference
A jupyter notebook to understand the correlation between variables to provide better predictions


#Data collection

The dataset has been collected from an open-source portal of Kaggle. The dataset can either be downloaded or collected using API calls.

#Data preprocessing and visualization

Using the libraries of matplotlib, seaborn and plotly, data visualization has been carried out and preprocessing has been implemented to simplify model fitting. 

In data preprocessing, categorical columns are converted to numeric ones and unnecessary columns are dropped.

#Model building

The dataset is split into training and testing dataset.

RandomForestClassifier is used to fit the model and an accuracy of 95% is achieved.
